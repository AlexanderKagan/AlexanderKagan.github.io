Work experience
======
**R&D Computational Science Intern** (*advised by Prof. Ziv Bar-Joseph*),
Sanofi, Summer 2024

**Research Assistant** (*advised by Prof. Leon Peshkin*), Kirshner Lab, Harvard Medical School, Jan 2021 – Apr 2024  
- Led a group of three MSc students developing hierarchical variable selection methods for classification problems with extensive dropouts (e.g., cell-type prediction with single-cell data)  
- Supervised two Ph.D. students applying Active Learning methods to identify the optimal order of sequential phenotype-to-drug response measurements  
- Developed function-on-function regression methods for phenotype prediction given kinase responses to drugs in multiple doses  
- Developed automatic cell nuclei detection methods for liver images using UNet CNNs
