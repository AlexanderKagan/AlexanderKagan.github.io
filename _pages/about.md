Hi! My name is Alex, I am a 5th year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Michigan, co-advised by Liza Levina and Ji Zhu. Previously, I did my undergrads in Mathematics at Higher School of Economics and masters in Computer Science at Skoltech, both in Moscow, Russia.

My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of **statistical network analysis** and **bioinformatics**, mainly focusing on:

- Modeling shared and group latent structures in collections of networks with applications to neuroscience
- Modeling of information diffusion on networks with applications to epidemiology and influence maximization
- Cross-validation and model selection in network-assisted regression problems
- Hierarchical feature selection in supervised and semi-supervised settings with applications to biomarker discovery


Here is my [CV](https://alexanderkagan.github.io/files/AcademicCV.pdf).
