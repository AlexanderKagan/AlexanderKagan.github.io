Hi! My name is Alex, I am a 5th year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Michigan, co-advised by Liza Levina and Ji Zhu. Previously, I did my undergrads in Mathematics at Higher School of Economics and masters in Computer Science at Skoltech, both in Moscow, Russia.

My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of statistical network analysis and bioinformatics, mainly focusing on:

- Latent space models for collections of networks with shared structure  
- Modeling of information diffusion on networks with applications to epidemiology and influence maximization  
- Model selection and cross-validation in network-assisted regression problems  
- Hierarchical feature selection for prediction problems with extensive drop-outs, motivated by proteomics and aging  


Here is my [CV](https://alexanderkagan.github.io/files/KaganCV.pdf).
